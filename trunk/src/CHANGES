The intent of this file it to document the _effect_ of recent code
changes, not just the change itself, which should be in the cvs log.

Changes can be specified by a noting a single file/version that is in
the commit or a tag.  If possible, use "cvs log" to get the date/time
that cvs thinks the commit was made, as it is different from local
time.

The comment should be a description of what you thinnk should be
changing, or just what really does change.

For searching convenience, please use BUGFIX when a bug is fixed, and
BUGGY when something breaks.

20060823 TAG: VERSION-3_20

----------------------------------------
20070119 TAG: BEFORE_MSG_DEL_1

Lots and lots of consensus changes since 3.20.

----------------------------------------
20070202 TAG: BEFORE_MSG_DEL_2

BUGFIX: Surrogates with more than two instances are now placed
correctly.  This results in more fragments in surrogates being placed
in contigs.  Results up to resolveSurrogates should be identical.

----------------------------------------
20070211 TAG: PRE-3_30-BRANCH (and VERSION-3_30)

VERSION-3_30 has some backported bug fixes, but it was branched here.
PRE-3_30-BRANCH is identical to the last tag.

----------------------------------------
20070221 TAG: TMP-3_31-STABLE_21FEB07

BUGGY!  InputDataTypes_CGW.h and GraphCGW_T.c removed the DEBUG_DATA
conditional, which changed the initial labeling of "potentially bogus"
mates, and changed scaffolding.

----------------------------------------
20070223 TAG: TMP-3_32-STABLE_23FEB07

Still buggy, the same as 3.31.

----------------------------------------
20070225 TAG: TMP-3_33-STABLE_25FEB07

Still buggy, the same as 3.31.

----------------------------------------
20070301 TAG: TMP-3_34-STABLE_03MAR07

Still buggy, the same as 3.31.

----------------------------------------
20070309 TAG: TMP-3_35-STABLE_09MAR07

BUGFIX!  Fixes the bug in 3.31, this is now the same as 3.30.

A change to the Chi Suared test results in more unitig link messages.

----------------------------------------
20070312 TAG: TMP-3_36-STABLE_12MAR07 (where it should be)

1) Consensus makes sure that identical (ungapped) reads are aligned
the same.  This changes both post-unitigger and post-scaffolding
consensus sequences.

2) The chimera detector now doesn't use evidence from OBT-deleted
reads.  This can slightly change the trimming on a small number of
reads.

----------------------------------------
20070314 TAG: TMP-3_37-STABLE_14MAR07

1) Overlap error rates now have 2 digits of precision, up from 1.
This can remove some borderline overlaps, and will change unitigger.

2) BUGGY!  Version 1.8 of AS_OVS/AS_OVS_overlapStore.c is needed to
fix it (from 3/16).

----------------------------------------
20070316 18:56:09 1.135 gdenisov AS_CNS/MultiAlignment_CNS.c
20070316 23:52:40 1.26  gdenisov AS_CNS/MultiAlignment_CNS.h

Local phasing.  Unknown what changes.

----------------------------------------

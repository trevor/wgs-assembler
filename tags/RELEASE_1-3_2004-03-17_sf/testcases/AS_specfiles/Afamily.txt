The A family of DNA specification files are intended for nightly
end-to-end run checks.  The first of the family is a full sized
synthetic human without the natural 0.2% polymorphism.  Later members
of the family are reduced in size, but not by a straight forward size
scaling. Sometimes I tried to maintain important features as while
reducing the total problem size.

Post CGW LSF Consensus Run (partitioned SeqStore and frgStore)
-------------------------------------------------------------

After partitioning of the fragStore/SeqStore (the partitioning is not
described here. Mike has done this and might have instrcutions.):

1)	Make a "final_consensus" directory.

	Copy the consensus binary to the "final_consensus" directory.
	Soft link the following files to the final_consensus directory:
	<prefix>.cns_contigs.*
	<prefix>.frgStore_part
	<prefix>.SeqStore
 
2)	The batch submission script is "submit_SDBPartitioned_consensus", and a typical
	command line follows.  It is recommended that you initially test
	with one partition first, to ensure batch submission works as expected:

	(the "1 1" part of the argument list to submit_SDB... direct the batch jobs to
	start with partition 1 and run through partition 1)

	command line:
	./submit_SDBPartitioned_consensus <queue> <prefix> <SDB_version> 1 1 <path_to_working_directory> <consensus_binary>

	for example:

	./submit_SDBPartitioned_consensus assembly mouse_20010730 49 1 1 /prod/IR02/mouse_20010730/workbox/SNAPBOX_MOUSE_20010730/cgw_run/final_consensus ./consensus

	You can tell if the process is functional by looking for a *.cns_tmp file that is created and growing.
	After any necessary troubleshooting, start the remaining partitions  (same command, but with the 
	range arguments "2 <last partition>" instead of "1 1".

3)	When the jobs are complete, check for any failures... _tmp files that weren't moved to .cns files
	is the signature.  Error logs for each partition are in the subdirectory batch_errfiles, and can 
	be browsed if there looks like there's a problem.

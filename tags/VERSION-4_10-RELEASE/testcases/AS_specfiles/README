The naming convention for testcases is as follows:

<genome>_cc_ppss_rr.sim

Where:
	<genome> is the name of a genome, e.g. a004
	cc is a two digit coverage depth, e.g., 10 or 04
	pp is a two digit maximum unclear range for prefixes 	
	ss is a two digit maximum unclear range for suffixes 
	rr is the ratio of 2k to 10k mates
